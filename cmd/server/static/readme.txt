This is a demonstration of using Vue and Bootstrap with minimal dependencies.

This demo explicitly avoids the use of NPM and the oodles of files in node_modules.
It also avoids the complexity of build tools like Webpack, Parcel, Rollup and Browserify.
It relies on the use of the RequireJS tool to load multiple app modules.
It also requires manual dependency management. 

These are the files that live in the lib directory:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/requirejs@2.3.6/require.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3.2.26/dist/vue.global.min.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
